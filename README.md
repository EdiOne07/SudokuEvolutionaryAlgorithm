# SudokuEvolutionaryAlgorithm
This project contains different implementations to solve sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
It includes two genetic algorithms and one depth-first search algorithm.

## Usage
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the first genetic algorithm, use:
```
python3 -m sudoku_1.algorithm
```

To run the second genetic algorithm, use:
```
python3 -m sudoku_2.evolution
```
