   abstract = {This paper studies the problems involved in solving, rating and generating Sudoku puzzles with genetic algorithms (GA). Sudoku is a number puzzle that has recently become a worldwide phenomenon. Sudoku can be regarded as a constraint satisfaction problem. When solved with genetic algorithms it can be handled as a multi-objective optimization problem. The three objectives of this study was: 1) to test if genetic algorithm optimization is an efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles, 2) can GA be used to generate new puzzles efficiently, and 3) can GA be used as a rating machine that evaluates the difficulty of a given Sudoku puzzle. The last of these objectives is approached by testing if puzzles that are considered difficult for a human solver are also difficult for the genetic algorithm. The results presented in this paper seem to support the conclusion that these objectives are reasonably well met with genetic algorithm optimization. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper handles the popular Sudoku puzzle and studies how to improve evolutionary algorithm solving by first pre-processing Sudoku solving with the most common known solving methods. We found that the pre-processing solves some of the easiest Sudoku’s so we do not even need other methods. With more difficult Sudoku’s the pre-processing reduce the positions needed to solve dramatically, which means that evolutionary algorithm finds the solution much faster than without the pre-processing.},

   abstract = {The Multi Depot Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Heterogeneous Vehicle Fleets combines many real-world constraints and is therefore a strongly practical-oriented routing problem. Due to its complexity, a solution approach with sufficiently good quality has to include several operators which are called with certain probability. However, the parameters modelling the probabilities strongly depend on the data structure of given instances. Thus, selecting the best parameter configuration for each given instance is a natural problem to enhance the overall solution quality. We present a Bayesian Optimization approach with Gaussian Processes in order to optimize the parameter configuration of a Grouping Genetic Algorithm. The parameter tuning is evaluated on five data sets with different numbers of depots and 1,200 problem instances each. It is shown that the parameter tuning approach is a good choice in improving the performance of the considered meta-heuristic over all instances in each data set. In addition, the best parameter configuration per problem class with the same characteristics is able to improve both the frequency of finding the best solution as well as the relative error to this solution significantly. Note to Practitioners-In the field of Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) transportation, goods have to be forwarded on the same vehicle from one customer to another. In practice, several restrictions are of interest when transportation requests are executed. The Multi-Depot Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Heterogeneous Vehicle Fleets (MDPDPTWHV) considered in this paper is a routing problem in the LTL-field including many practical constraints. In order to solve instances of such a problem, a sufficiently good meta-heuristic can be applied. However, the variety of constraints makes it hard to solve problem instances of different data structure regarding comparative (solution) quality. In particular, the quality depends on the interaction of the meta-heuristic's operators, which can be controlled by configuration parameters. Thus, customizing these parameters for certain data structures of different problem instances can enhance the solution quality and consequently produce reasonable results for complex routing problems such as the MDPDPTWHV. In the paper at hand, a sophisticated Genetic Algorithm is presented at first in order to solve the considered routing problem. Secondly, a solution approach is introduced which finds sufficiently good configuration parameters of the Genetic Algorithm's operators for a given data structure so that the problem instances which are of this structure can be solved This work was supported by the BMBF project "L2O: Learning to Opti-mize" [grant number 01IS20013A]. efficiently. This approach can be adopted to any meta-heuristic which controls its operators by configuration parameters. Nevertheless , in order to find appropriate parameters, the approach has to be performed before the actual routing problem can be solved. This can be time-consuming, which is a clear limitation in the LTL-field. Consequently, as future research, the approach at hand can be used in order to find suitable parameters for predefined classes of data structures. New instances can then be classified to one class, from which the previously calculated configuration parameters are applied to the considered meta-heuristic.},
