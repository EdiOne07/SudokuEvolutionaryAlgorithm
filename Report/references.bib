   abstract = {This paper studies the problems involved in solving, rating and generating Sudoku puzzles with genetic algorithms (GA). Sudoku is a number puzzle that has recently become a worldwide phenomenon. Sudoku can be regarded as a constraint satisfaction problem. When solved with genetic algorithms it can be handled as a multi-objective optimization problem. The three objectives of this study was: 1) to test if genetic algorithm optimization is an efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles, 2) can GA be used to generate new puzzles efficiently, and 3) can GA be used as a rating machine that evaluates the difficulty of a given Sudoku puzzle. The last of these objectives is approached by testing if puzzles that are considered difficult for a human solver are also difficult for the genetic algorithm. The results presented in this paper seem to support the conclusion that these objectives are reasonably well met with genetic algorithm optimization. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper handles the popular Sudoku puzzle and studies how to improve evolutionary algorithm solving by first pre-processing Sudoku solving with the most common known solving methods. We found that the pre-processing solves some of the easiest Sudoku’s so we do not even need other methods. With more difficult Sudoku’s the pre-processing reduce the positions needed to solve dramatically, which means that evolutionary algorithm finds the solution much faster than without the pre-processing.},
