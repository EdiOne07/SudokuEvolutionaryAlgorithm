This section describes the setup of experiments \cite{zobel2014experimentation}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide the details of the hardware and software that you used.
    \item Describe the steps you carried out during your experiments.
    \item Detail the data you used for the evaluation of your algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Problem with Implementation 1}
This implementation leads to a situation where the diversity of the population decreases rapidly, resulting in premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. On most of the runs, the algorithm creates more than 100,000 generations before finding a valid solution.  
To counter this problem, we have tried to increase the mutation rate and the population size, as well as introducing new random individuals in each generation. However, these adjustments only led to marginal improvements in performance.
