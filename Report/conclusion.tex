This paper studied the efficiency of solving Sudoku puzzles with GA approaches of different complexities. The results show that the performance on 9x9 boards varies drastically. While most easy boards can be solved fast, the algorithm struggles on medium and hard boards. Only 10\% of medium boards can be solved in under 2 second. For puzzles of hard difficulties the algorithm did not achieve a single solution in under 2 seconds. Additionally, the success rate of the GA in finding a solution to the puzzle decreased with increasing complexity of the problem. While 100\% of the easy boards were solved, only 91.4\% and 45\% of boards were solved of medium and hard complexity respectively. 

The naive search algorithm DFS found solutions for every puzzle of every difficulty. Furthermore, the mean solving time of the boards of hard difficulty is 0.112 seconds, while easier puzzles were solved even faster. 

These results show that while GAs can be used to solve Sudoku puzzles, they do not outperform naive search approaches. This is the case in the Sudoku context because there is only one optimal solution (solving the board without any duplicates). GAs are not optimal. They perform well in finding solutions that are "good enough". When solving Sudokus however, only the optimal solution is relevant. The algorithm finds local maxima quickly, but then gets stuck in those in many cases. The algorithm reacts by soft resetting the population. This is done by generating a new population and combining it with some of the worst performing individuals of the stuck generation. This helps the algorithm to get out of a local maximum, but it doesn't guarantee to find the optimal solution next. This is the reason why 55\% of hard difficulty boards could not be solved in 100.000 generations.

This led to the decision of not evaluating the performance of the bigger $16 \times 16$ and $25 \times 25$ boards in this paper. It is expected that the performance of bigger grids is even worse, especially since the increase in complexity is far greater when increasing the size of the boards compared reducing given numbers in a $9 \times 9$ puzzle.

Future research may consist of combining GAs with different optimization approaches. If a significant increase in performance on 9x9 boards can be achieved, these hybrid GAs may be suitable for solving bigger $16 \times 16$ and $25 \times 25$ Sudoku puzzles.
